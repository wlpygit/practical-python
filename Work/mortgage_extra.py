""" Dave has decided to take out a 30-year fixed rate mortgage of $500,000 with Guidoâ€™s
 Mortgage, Stock Investment, and Bitcoin trading corporation. The interest rate is 5% and 
the monthly payment is $2684.11.

Here is a program that calculates the total amount that Dave will have to pay over the 
life of the mortgage: """
